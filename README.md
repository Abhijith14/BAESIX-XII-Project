**1. INTRODUCTION**

	1.1 About the Project

		1.1.1 BAESIX-An Overview

			Basic Algorithmic file Encoded as a Simple program Intended to Entertain you Xtendly”- shortened as BAESIX:- is a software that facilitate the creation and sharing of information, ideas, career interests and other forms of expression using the basic programming language C++. In simple words it’s a basic model of Social media management software (SMMS) - an application program or software suite module that facilitates an organization's ability to successfully engage in social media across different communication channels.

			When engaging with these services, users can create highly interactive platforms through which individuals, communities, and organizations can share, co-create, discuss, and modify user-generated content or pre-made content posted online. They "introduce substantial and pervasive changes to communication between organizations, communities, and individuals." BAESIX mainly focus on the emerging fields of technoself studies, But still in a basic form. BAESIX differ from other social media software as it posts only ideas and suggestions across different users and does not support networking.
			
			Social media intelligence enables brands to:
			•	Heighten brand awareness
			•	Increase social community size
			•	Accurately target audiences
			•	Strengthen engagement strategies for increased brand loyalty
			•	Increase customer satisfaction and positive brand perception
			•	Convert social followers into qualified leads and new business
			
			Modern SMMS’s generally have many more features as posting a video or an image or even playing multiplayer online games and more. The feature set differs between different applications or websites; however, this project deals with simple and basic features including text messaging and chatting and sharing ideas or suggestions. 

		1.1.2 Objective of the PROJECT

				The main objective of the project “BAESIX” is to help the user to share their ideas
				or suggestions among their follower.
				It helps the user to also to chat with their friends.
				Thus we get the trust of each user by our way to be S.M.A.R.T. (Specific, Measureable, Achievable, Realistic, and Timely).

**4. CONCLUTION**

	“Basic Algorithmic file Encoded as a Simple program Intending to entertain you Xtendly” shortened as BAESIX is a basic form of what now we call a “SOCIAL MEDIA”. In this modern era everyone is very into social media. It has became a part of our life. Social media is defined as relationship that exist between network and people. Thus via this software, we provide the facilities for users to share and connect with one another. BAESIX thus becomes the best by our way to be S.M.A.R.T. (Specific, Measureable, Achievable, Realistic, and Timely).

	This project helps users to create highly interactive platforms through which individuals, communities, and organizations can share, co-create, discuss, and modify user-generated content or pre-made content posted. They "introduce substantial and pervasive changes to communication between organizations, communities, and individuals." BAESIX mainly focus on the emerging fields of technoself studies, But still in a basic form. BAESIX differ from other social media software as it posts only ideas and suggestions across different users and does not support networking.

	However this project is not safe. Many softwares has now the facility to create fake Id’s which will not be identified and can thus access others privacy without their knowledge. Moreover they can hack your informations and also alter it. Our codewriter team are trying our best to prevent such efforts. Currently this project is just a prototype.There are many modifications to be made in this project to make it safe. These modifications would be made in this project gradually. There are many more modifications to be made so as to this project becomes more user friendly.
	 
		project to do all work ease and fast.
